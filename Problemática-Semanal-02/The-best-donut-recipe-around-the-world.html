                    Doughnuts</a> (or donuts) are one of the most popular fried snacks that unites cultures around the world.
                    Doughnuts come in all sizes and shapes: rings, holes, spheres, twists, and balls. It’s hard to argue that
                    everyone enjoys fried dough no matter what shape or form it is served in. As long as it’s hot, fresh, and fried
                    crisp!

                    Most <a class="links-article" href="https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/donuts">doughnut recipes</a> include flour, water, sugar, oil,
                    eggs, milk, and shortening. Jellies, chocolate, cream, powdered sugar, and many other flavorings are used as
                    toppings and fillings. To make doughnuts at home you only need some basic equipment: a large saucepan or Dutch
                    oven for frying, a wooden spoon or spider, a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and perhaps a piping
                    bag.

                    The doughnuts we see in stores across the United States today are said to have been
                    <a class="links-article" href="https://www.chowhound.com/food-news/202179/where-did-donuts-originate/">brought by the Dutch settlers
                    in the early 18th century</a>. They were called olykoeks. Yet most cuisines have their own form of this sweet
                    popular delicacy.

                    Similar to a cruller, this light, spongy ring of dough is deep fried in oil, and eaten either plain, or with
                    sugar or honey. You can find street vendors selling fresh sfenj in many parts of Moroco, Algeria, Tunisia, and
                    Libya. Sfenj is typically eaten for breakfast and in the afternoon, accompanied by

                    Balushahi or Badusha is a traditional Indian dessert that is served at weddings and festivals. It is very sweet
                    and crisp on the outside, and has a soft interior. Making balushahi at home requires a bit of patience, but the
                    effort is well worth the result. Make a soft dough by kneading flour, ghee (clarified butter), yogurt, salt,
                    baking soda, and ice cold water. Make small balls and fry in ghee on low heat. Soak in sugar syrup, let sit for
                    few hours, and top with chopped pistachios, cardamom powder, and

                    They are made with wheat-based dough, with and without yeast, and often contain anise flavoring. Shaped as
                    balls, rounds, flat discs, or cylinders, the individual pieces are deep-fried in refined coconut oil and
                    sprinkled with granulated sugar. Variations may include glutinous rice flour or mashed bananas mixed with
                    all-purpose flour.

                    Lokma is a traditional Turkish dessert, but you will find versions of it in the Middle East, Greece, and the
                    Balkans. Golden and crispy on the outside and almost juicy on the inside, lokma is not as doughy as a
                    traditional doughnut. It is relatively easy to make as you don’t need to leave the batter out for long or worry
                    about the shape. Fry the rounded balls in hot oil and soak in a heavy syrup of sugar and lemon juice. Sprinkled
                    ground walnuts, pistachios, or sesame seeds, and serve warm. Try this
